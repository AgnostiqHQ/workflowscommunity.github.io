        The interplay of workflow technologies and HPC has been challenged by the fast rise of AI and ML technologies.
        Workflows empowered with ML techniques largely differ from traditional workflows running on HPC machines. In
        this BoF, we bring together researchers from the <strong>workflows, HPC, and AI/ML</strong>
        communities that work on scientific research questions that require large-scale, distributed, and AI-heavy
        computing. The session will present an update on challenges, opportunities, new research directions, and future
        pathways, and will seek input for updating a community roadmap on HPC and AI workflows research and development.
