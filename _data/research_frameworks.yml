  description: RO-Crate is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata. It aims to make best-practice in formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wider variety of situations, from an individual researcher working with a folder of data, to large data-intensive computational research environments.
