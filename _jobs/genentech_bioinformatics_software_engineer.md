## The Position

Genentech seeks a talented and highly motivated Bioinformatics Software Engineer with expert knowledge of modern genomic data processing workflows and their application to cutting-edge biological sciences. The team you are joining supports gRED scientists with highly scalable and reproducible workflows for the analysis of pre-clinical and clinical sequencing data from transcriptomic, genomic, and (epi)-genetic assays  at the bulk and single cell level.

The primary focus of this position is to maintain and extend an orchestration system for high throughput genomic workflows to scale with the ever growing data volume and diversity as biology becomes a quantitative science. Your work will enable us to readily deploy our containerized workflows, with an emphasis on reproducibility and scalability, to public and private  cloud environments so we can compute where the data resides. You are well informed about evolving and established data standards, workflow frameworks and relevant open source tools. You can evaluate and incorporate these tools into our data platform and complement them with your own software as needed.

A successful candidate will collaborate with interdisciplinary teams of Software Engineers, DevOps engineers and Computational Biology Scientists to deploy and execute genomic workflows on thousands of samples and hundreds of projects at any given time. You are adapting our platform to new compute environments and continually make it more performant and robust. You are guiding our workflow developers to optimize their  workflows for throughput, reliability  and cost.

*This position may be eligible for relocation and visa sponsorship

Successful candidates will meet many of the following requirements

- You have a PhD in Software Engineering, Computer Science, Bioinformatics, or similar and 2-3 years of relevant experience in a clinical, academic or commercial setting. Alternatively, a Master degree or equivalent and at least 5-8 years of relevant experience.
- You have expert knowledge of a modern genomic framework system (ideally cromwell/WDL, alternatively CWL, nextflow, toil) and have not only written workflows but have looked behind the curtain and deployed or configured the framework in a public or private cloud environment or on a large HPC
- You have expert knowledge of containerization in the context of genomic workflows, including automatic builds, CI/CD and  container registries (e.g. dockstore, quai.io)
- You have successfully analyzed large cohorts using an automated workflow system and were involved in all aspects of the process from data acquisition, over workflow development to data processing and interpretation.
- Experience in managing  data according to FAIR principles as well as tracking data lineage, ensuring data quality and improving data discovery is a plus as well as experience with data standards used by large genomics consortia.
- You have successfully planned and implemented multiple software projects throughout the whole development cycle (planning, implementation, testing, release, maintenance) following modern software development practices.
- You are able to break down large problems into smaller software components and can develop them independently or as part of a large team.
- Experience in managing  data according to FAIR principles as well as tracking data lineage, ensuring data quality and improving data discovery is a plus.
- You have strong experience in the use of a high-level, object oriented  programming language such as Python, Go or Java and a strong understanding of Linux/Unix.
- You have knowledge of best practices for software engineering including but not limited to IaC, CI/CD, and software containerization.
- You are comfortable working both independently and collaboratively, and with handling several concurrent, fast-paced projects.
- You are able to execute technical projects at global scale, across multiple teams and time zones. Strategic, analytical mindset and ability to innovate using technology to advance business goals. 
- You have strong communication skills and can untangle and discuss complex technical tasks.
- Prior experience  in a life science or drug development environment is beneficial.

## What to expect from us

- A highly collaborative and dynamic research environment where we aim to advance the rate of scientific discovery using purposefully built solutions.
- Access to large data sets, samples and compute resources.
- Access to state-of-the-art technologies and pioneering research.
- Participation in seminar series featuring academic and industry scientists.
- Campus-like lifestyle with a healthy work-life balance.
- Mentored opportunities to further develop professional skills.
