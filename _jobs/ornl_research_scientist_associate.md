## Overview

Oak Ridge National Laboratory is the largest US Department of Energy science and energy laboratory, conducting basic and applied research to deliver transformative solutions to compelling problems in energy and security.

The Data Lifecycle and Scalable Workflows Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is seeking a self-motivated research professional who wants to apply their knowledge, skills, and abilities to data and workflow projects.  In this role, you are expected to contribute research and develop solutions to address challenges in deploying scientific workflows on our Leadership Computing infrastructure, and across ORNL’s computational and experimental facilities.

## Our Team

Our mission is to empower scientists to succeed by building and delivering tools, infrastructure, processes, and best practices for organizing their data and workflows, and making them universally accessible, understandable, findable, shareable, and reproducible.  We are an exciting and creative group of research and technical professionals that have a passion for data management and enabling science across domains.

## Our Organization

This position is part of the Advanced Technologies Section within the National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS) Division.  The Advanced Technologies Section offers scientific, technical, operational, and thought leadership by developing, hardening, and deploying solutions for compute and data intensive computing environments.  The NCCS provides state-of-the-art computational and data science infrastructure, coupled with dedicated technical and scientific professionals, to accelerate scientific discovery and engineering advances across a broad range of disciplines. NCCS hosts the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, one of DOE’s National User Facilities. NCCS is currently deploying the U.S.’s first Exascale system.

### Major Duties/Responsibilities: 

- Research novel architectures and implement state of the art technologies for data and workflow management systems.
- Contribute to the development and implementation of components of an ORNL computing and data ecosystem.
- Respond to ORNL's workflow users’ needs and identify technologies for automating and advancing their work.
- Collaborate with internal researchers on applying large-scale distributed computing techniques to scientific applications.
- Increase community workflow awareness.
- Present research results to sponsors, peer reviewers, and others and at national and international technical society meetings.
- Improve workflow awareness within ORNL and the DOE environment.
- Contribute to the organization of virtual international workflows community events.
- Interact with industry and government sponsors in pursuit of new and additional research funding.
- Develop research proposals to internal and external funding agencies that solicit new and ongoing work.
- Publish original work in technical reports, peer reviewed journals, and professional society magazines.
- Mentor students.
 
### Basic Qualifications:

- Ph.D. in computer science, engineering or related fields; alternatively, a M.S in computer science with 4+ years of work experience.
- 2+ years of programming experience in Python, C, or C++.
 
### Preferred Qualifications:

- Demonstrated experience with machine orchestration methods (scientific workflows).
- Publication and presentation track record that demonstrates contributions to the scientific community.
- Experience with serverless/edge computing.
- Familiarity with message-broker software (e.g., RabbitMQ).
- Knowledge of modeling and simulation, and benchmarking of parallel and distributed computing systems.
- Familiarity with the FAIR data and research software principles.
- Ability to learn new programming languages and technologies.
- Resourcefulness, troubleshooting aptitude, and attention to detail.
- Strong communication skills, ability to communicate effectively with internal collaborators and to work in a team environment.
- Motivated self-starter with the ability to work independently and to participate creatively in collaborative teams across the laboratory 
- Ability to function well in a fast-paced research environment, set priorities to accomplish multiple tasks within deadlines, and adapt to ever changing needs
