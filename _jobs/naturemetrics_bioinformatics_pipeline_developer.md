Applications are invited for a Bioinformatics Pipeline Developer to join an expanding science-based SME. The successful candidate will work closely with other members of the Bioinformatics department on developing cloud-native, secure, scalable infrastructure for our rapidly growing business. The role will report to the Senior Bioinformatics Engineer and be a critical component of the Bioinformatics Infrastructure team.

Applicants should have experience of developing, optimising, orchestrating, and scaling bioinformatics pipelines in the cloud, or on significant HPC infrastructure. A good understanding of containerisation strategies, CI/CD and testing frameworks is desirable.

The successful applicant will be comfortable working independently and as part of a wider team. They will be required to work closely with all members of the Bioinformatics team, taking requirements and input from our Bioinformatics Product Delivery and Bioinformatics R&D teams to ensure we are able to meet our scale up challenges.
