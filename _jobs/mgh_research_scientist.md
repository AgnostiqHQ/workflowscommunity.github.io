## General Summary/ Overview Statement

The Dunn lab in the Department of Neurosurgery at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) is seeking a motivated, enthusiastic Research Scientist. The scientist will use computational approaches to analyze, integrate, and interpret large-scale genomic data -- with an emphasis on single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomic, and exome sequencing data -- to study intratumoral heterogeneity and the immune microenvironment of brain tumors. Current projects address topics such as the interplay of genetic, transcriptional, spatial, and immunological heterogeneity in brain tumors such as glioblastoma and meningioma. The scientist will work in a highly collaborative environment, involving extensive interaction with faculty, molecular biologists, computational biologists, programmers, and clinicians. The scientist will assist in developing and conducting research projects, including experiment design, data management, data analysis, and documentation of experiment results.

### Principal Duties And Responsibilities
- Investigate, implement, and evaluate bioinformatic and statistical software in R and/or Python to analyze, visualize, and interpret high-throughput, massively parallel genomic data, especially single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomic, and exome sequencing data.
- Design, develop, and implement bioinformatic software and computational approaches for the analysis and interpretation of scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic data.
- Manage and organize large data sets to facilitate storage, analysis, and public dissemination.
- Train other researchers on the everyday use of analysis software.
- Assist with grant preparation and reporting of methods, data, and results.
- Solve practical problems relating to computational resources and data sets; suggest technical or procedural improvements in research methodology.
- Contribute to scientific literature, write research reports, and present research at scientific forums.

### Skills/Abilities/Competencies Required
- Demonstrated ability to work independently and productively.
- Strong research design and analytical skills, with demonstrated ability to problem solve.
- Strong teaching skills and ability to supervise trainees and students.
- In-depth knowledge of bioinformatics, statistics, and cancer biology.
- Proficiency in the *nix shell, Python and/or R, workflow languages (e.g. WDL), and cloud computing.
- Experience applying R-based or Python-based statistical, bioinformatic, and machine learning tools to genomic data sets.
- Experience with quantitative analysis of large, multidimensional data sets, particularly gene expression and/or next-generation sequencing data.
- Strong oral and written communication skills.

### Education
- PhD in computational biology, bioinformatics, genomics, or a related field.

### Experience
- More than 2 years of post-doctoral experience in computational biology or bioinformatics preferred.

### Supervisory Responsibility
- Provides oversight to students and research trainees.

### Working Conditions
- Normal lab environment.
