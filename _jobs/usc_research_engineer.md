## About Us

The SciTech group does research and development on software systems to help scientists manage large-scale computations. We work with scientists in domains ranging from genomics and proteomics to seismology and gravitational wave physics. We help scientists deploy their computations on some of the largest and fastest computing systems in the world. Our main project is the Pegasus Workflow Management system, which is used to orchestrate complex, large-scale data processing and computation pipelines. Pegasus compiles abstract, high-level workflow descriptions into efficient executable workflows that can be deployed on diverse cyberinfrastructure. In this process it expands and optimizes the workflow, adding data management tasks and performing task clustering, cleanup and other optimizations.

The SciTech group is part of the USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI). A unit of the University of Southern California’s highly ranked Viterbi School of Engineering, ISI is one of the nation’s largest, most successful university-affiliated computer research institutes. ISI researchers bridge the gap between theoretical basic research and product-oriented research and development. Its diverse expertise ranges from core engineering and computer science discovery to design, modeling and implementation of innovative prototypes and devices. ISI is located in beautiful, sunny Marina Del Rey, California. Our offices overlook the ocean and are just minutes from the beach.
