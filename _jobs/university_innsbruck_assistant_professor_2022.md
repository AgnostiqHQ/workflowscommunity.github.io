## About the job 

The Department of Computer Science (at the Faculty of Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics) at the University of Innsbruck seeks to fill the joint position of a full-time **Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the area of Cloud, Edge and IoT Computing** as soon as possible, ideally by 01.12.2022. This position is initially limited to 6 years; a tenure-track agreement can be offered within the first year of employment. Upon positive evaluation, the position is converted into a tenured Associate Professorship. This career position is embedded within an attractive environment of existing competencies close to the above thematic area, including distributed systems, parallel systems, software engineering, data management, security and privacy.

## Tasks
The successful applicant should represent the area of Cloud, Edge and IoT Computing in research and teaching. Here, Cloud, Edge and IoT Computing refers to distributed systems with a particular focus on highly decentralized, scalable, performance-oriented, and resilient application development environments, runtime systems and resource management. Example research foci include: 

- application development environments and tools
- scalable, decentralized runtime systems and middleware
- optimization of applications and runtime systems (e.g. for runtime, energy, cost and resilience)
- decentralized and energy-aware management and allocation of compute and data resources (e.g. based on OpenStack)
- distributed processing, management, and transfer of large-scale data
- distributed scheduling, resilience, and self-organization
- instrumentation, monitoring and analysis of the non-functional behavior (e.g. time, energy, cost, reliability) of application, runtime, and resource layer
- service composition, provisioning, and orchestration (e.g. based on Kubernetes or FaaS technologies)
- mobile computing and autonomous agents

Teaching comprises lectures, especially in the area of distributed systems, for the degree programs of the Department of Computer Science. Tenured Associate Professors are also expected to teach mandatory courses in the Bachelor’s program. 

Acquisition and scientific management of third-party funded research projects is expected. Supervision and co-supervision of Bachelor’s, Master’s and PhD students, as well as the participation in organizational/administrative tasks and in evaluation measures is a matter of course.

## Required Qualifications
1. Doctoral degree in computer science or a related field;
2. Postdoctoral work experience after the dissertation/PhD;
3. Pertinent and independent scientific achievements beyond the dissertation/PhD;
4. Experience in research and SW development, and international visibility in the area of Cloud, Edge and IoT computing; 
5. Relevant publications in leading international, refereed conference proceedings and journals as well as presentations at international conferences and workshops;
6. Research collaborations with international partners;
7. Experience in the acquisition and implementation of externally-funded research projects;
8. Experience in the (co-)supervision of Bachelor’s and Master’s theses;
9. Pertinent experience in academic mobility during or after the PhD;
10. Proficiency (written and oral) in English;
11. Willingness to teach in German within two years after appointment;
12. Didactic competence and teaching experience expected;
13. Social competencies, communication skills, and ability to work in teams

## How to Apply
The application must be submitted in English and must contain:

1. CV with a description of the academic and professional career;
2. List of scientific publications;
3. List of scientific presentations, other scientific achievements, and projects;
4. Names and contact information of at least two references;
5. Description of a research plan at the level of a habilitation;
6. Teaching statement and a list of courses taught with evaluations (if available)
