## Overview

Oak Ridge National Laboratory is the largest US Department of Energy science and energy laboratory, conducting basic and applied research to deliver transformative solutions to compelling problems in energy and security.

The Data Lifecycle and Scalable Workflows Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is seeking a self-motivated and innovative research professional with expertise in data and workflows.  In this role, you are expected to research and develop solutions to address challenges in deploying scientific workflows on our Leadership Computing infrastructure, and across ORNL’s computational and experimental facilities. 

## Our Team

Our mission is to empower scientists to succeed by building and delivering tools, infrastructure, processes, and best practices for organizing their data and workflows, and making them universally accessible, understandable, findable, shareable, and reproducible.  We are an exciting and creative group of research and technical professionals that have a passion for data management and enabling science across domains.

## Our Organization

This position is part of the Advanced Technologies Section within the National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS) Division.  The Advanced Technologies Section offers scientific, technical, operational, and thought leadership by developing, hardening, and deploying solutions for compute and data intensive computing environments.  The NCCS provides state-of-the-art computational and data science infrastructure, coupled with dedicated technical and scientific professionals, to accelerate scientific discovery and engineering advances across a broad range of disciplines. NCCS hosts the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, one of DOE’s National User Facilities. NCCS is currently deploying the U.S.’s first Exascale system.
