## Introduction

In 2022, Nextflow and nf-core are starting a joint program of mentorships. We hope to organise a small number of mentoring pairs to improve outreach and training in underrepresented groups and areas. Mentors will receive a small stipend in return for helping their mentee.

## Scope

Some typical aims could be:

- Setting up Nextflow and nf-core in your institution
  - Getting requirements up and running on the local compute infrastructure
  - Developing an institutional config for you and others to use
  - Testing and scaling up the use of nf-core pipelines
- Learning how to make a contribution to nf-core
  - Developing new and / or contributing to existing pipeline(s)
  - Working with nf-core/tools or the website
  - Presenting a nf-core/bytesize talk about a chosen topic
  - Writing an extensive tutorial about some aspect of nf-core

The exact scope and aims of each mentoring partnership can vary according to the participants' needs and situation.
These will be judged on a case-by-case basis as part of the application process.
