Scientific software developers are sought to join an ambitious, well-funded interdisciplinary research group based in New York City. Successful candidates will work closely with our world-class team of chemists, biologists, and computer scientists on developing large-scale scientific workflows to support our drug discovery research efforts.

Particularly relevant areas of expertise will include large-scale data analysis, tool integration, workflow engineering/development, high performance data-parallel computing, systems software, machine learning, and Python programming, among other things, but specific knowledge of any of these areas is less critical than intellectual curiosity, versatility, and a track record of achievement. Having a scientific background is preferred, but not required.

D. E. Shaw Research is pursuing a long-term strategy aimed at fundamentally transforming the process of drug discovery. Our group has developed multiple generations of a special-purpose supercomputer, ANTONÂ®, capable of simulating biomolecular phenomena orders of magnitude faster than was previously possible, and we are currently working on a number of drug discovery programs focusing on drug targets that span a range of therapeutic areas.

We take great pride in the caliber of our team, and we offer above-market compensation. We also provide generous relocation and immigration assistance to new hires. In addition, we strive to support the personal and professional needs of our team members by offering generous benefits, opportunities for community engagement, and a variety of learning and development programs.
