Discover personalized medical solutions for environmentally triggered diseases to promote a healthier society in a rapidly changing world.

The Schneider lab at the Institute of Functional Epigenetics () focuses on understanding the epigenetic mechanisms whereby cells and organisms integrate metabolic signals, establish cellular memory and regulate plasticity. We use cutting-edge methods (multi-omics, single cell, modelling, chromatin biochemistry) and model systems from yeast to stem cells to predict, observe, and manipulate epigenetic processes.

We are offering a

Scientist Position in Computational Biology/ Bioinformatics/ AI in Epigenetics (f/m/x)101610

Postdocs

### Your responsibilities
The position will involve the analysis and integration of multiple and large datasets to understand genome function, epigenetic memory and transcriptional regulation. The successful candidate will be tasked with the development, implementation and standardisation of low-input or single cell genomic pipelines, the integration of data from several “omics “datasets and the introduction of machine learning and AI approaches to understand epigenetic regulation of chromatin function. The applicant will be part of a computational team with close collaborations with wet-lab scientists and leading Computational Biology/AI in Health groups at Helmholtz Munich. Working language is English.

### Your Qualifications
You should have a Ph.D in Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, Computational Biology, Systems Biology or Molecular Biology with a previous extensive experience in bioinformatics, computational analyses and data integration. We specifically look for independent thinkers, who are willing to shape a project by developing their own ideas. Experience with NGS datasets (e.g. ChIPseq, CUT&Run, or CUT&Tag, ATACseq and RNAseq) as well as their relevant data analysis tools and pipelines is mandatory. Proficiency in scripting languages, experience with workflow management systems and high-performance computing cluster environments would be an advantage. Knowledge of molecular gene regulation, chromatin and epigenetics are beneficial.

Total E-Quality Award for excellent gender equality policy for women and men: Helmholtz Munich is particularly committed to promoting professional equality between women and men. It therefore aims to increase the proportion of the underrepresented sex in the respective field. Helmholtz Munich is part of the Helmholtz Association, Germany's largest scientific organization. Altogether 43.000 people currently work in its 18 scientific-technical and biological-medical research centers. The Association's annual budget amounts to around 5 billion Euros.
