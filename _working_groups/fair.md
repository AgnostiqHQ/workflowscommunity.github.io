The FAIR principles have laid a foundation for sharing and publishing digital assets and, in particular, data. The
FAIR principles emphasize machine accessibility and that all digital assets should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
and Reusable. Workflows encode the methods by which the scientific process is conducted and via which data are created.
It is thus important that workflows both support the creation of FAIR data and themselves adhere to the FAIR principles.

## Goals

In this working group, we seek to:
- Define FAIR principles for computational workflows that consider the complex lifecycle from specification to execution and data products
- Define metrics to measure the FAIRness of a workflow
- Define recommendations for FAIR workflow developers and systems
- Define processes to automate FAIRness in workflows by recording necessary provenance data
