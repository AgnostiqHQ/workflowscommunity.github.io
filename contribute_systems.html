        The Workflows Community Initiative (WCI) provides a curated collection of actively-developed open source
        workflow
        systems. The main goal of this collection is to showcase workflow system capabilities developed by the
        community. We
        invite all workflow system developers and users to share their workflow systems through this collection.

    <h3>Adding a Workflow Repository</h3>
    <p>
        In order to add a workflow system repository, you only need to add the organization and repository names into an
        YAML
        file hosted as part of the <a href="https://github.com/workflowscommunity/workflowscommunity.github.io"
            target="_blank">WCI GitHub repository</a>. The preferred way to submit your changes is via creating a pull
        request
        with the changes. To this end, these are the recommended steps for adding a workflow system:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Fork</strong> the WCI GitHub repository</li>
        <li><strong>Clone</strong> your forked repository:
            <pre>git clone https://github.com/&#60;your_username>/workflowscommunity.github.io</pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Edit</strong> the <code>_data/workflow_systems.yml</code> file, and add the information regarding
            the workflow system repository:
            <pre>
- organization: github-organization
  repository: workflow-system-repository
  type: github</pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Commit</strong> the changes, and create a <strong>pull request</strong> for the WCI GitHub
            repository.</li>
        <li>The WCI team will then evaluate your pull request, and merge the changes if the workflow system repository
            and examples are properly documented.</li>
    </ol>
